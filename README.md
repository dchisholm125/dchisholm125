- 👋 Hi, I’m @dchisholm125
- 👀 I’ve been a Software Engineer for 2 years, and have been tinkering with C# and Java for a further 2 years before that. I love efficiency, and am always searching to optimize my code or increase performance.
- 🌱 I’m currently honing more advanced M.E.R.N. technology stack skills and brushing up on NoSQL databases alongside Bootstrap styling and React.JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to help build iron-clad connections from back-end logic to front-end business logic, or even some fun GameDev projects!
- 📫 How to reach me
